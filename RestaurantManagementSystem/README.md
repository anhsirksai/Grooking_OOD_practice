# Design a Restaurant Management system
Let's design a restaurant management system.

A Restaurant Management System is a software built to handle all restaurant activities in an easy and safe manner. This System will give the Restaurant management power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single portal. The system allows the manager to keep track of available tables in the system as well as the reservation of tables and bill generation.

# System Requirements
We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Restaurant Management System:
1. The restaurant will have different branches.<br>

2. Each restaurant branch will have a menu.<br>

3. The menu will have different menu sections, containing different menu items.<br>

4. The waiter should be able to create an order for a table and add meals for each seat.<br>

5. Each meal can have multiple meal items. Each meal item corresponds to a menu item.<br>

6. The system should be able to retrieve information about tables currently available to seat walk-in customers.<br>

7. The system should support the reservation of tables.<br>

8. The receptionist should be able to search for available tables by date/time and reserve a table.<br>

9. The system should allow customers to cancel their reservation.<br>

10. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reservation time is approaching.<br>

11. The customers should be able to pay their bills through credit card, check or cash.<br>

12. Each restaurant branch can have multiple seating arrangements of tables.<br>

# Use case diagram
Here are the main Actors in our system:
* **Receptionist**: Mainly responsible for adding and modifying tables and their layout, and creating and canceling table reservations.<br>
* **Waiter**: To take/modify orders.<br>
* **Manager**: Mainly responsible for adding new workers and modifying the menu.<br>
* **Chef**: To view and work on an order.<br>
* **Cashier**: To generate checks and process payments.<br>
* **System**: Mainly responsible for sending notifications about table reservations, cancellations, etc.<br>

Here are the top use cases of the Restaurant Management System:
* **Add/Modify tables**: To add, remove, or modify a table in the system.<br>
* **Search tables**: To search for available tables for reservation.<br>
* **Place order**: Add a new order in the system for a table.<br>
* **Update order**: Modify an already placed order, which can include adding/modifying meals or meal items.<br>
* **Create a reservation**: To create a table reservation for a certain date/time for an available table.<br>
* **Cancel reservation**: To cancel an existing reservation.<br>
* **Check-in**: To let the guest check in for their reservation.<br>
* **Make payment**: Pay the check for the food.<br>

# Class diagram
Here is the description of the different classes of our Restaurant Management System:
* **Restaurant**: This class represents a restaurant. Each restaurant has registered employees. The employees are part of the restaurant because if the restaurant becomes inactive, all its employees will automatically be deactivated.<br>

* **Branch**: Any restaurants can have multiple branches. Each branch will have its own set of employees and menus.<br>

* **Menu**: All branches will have their own menu.<br>

* **MenuSection and MenuItem**: A menu has zero or more menu sections. Each menu section consists of zero or more menu items.<br>

* **Table and TableSeat**: The basic building block of the system. Every table will have a unique identifier, maximum sitting capacity, etc. Each table will have multiple seats.<br>

* **Order**: This class encapsulates the order placed by a customer.<br>

* **Meal**: Each order will consist of separate meals for each table seat.<br>

* **Meal Item**: Each Meal will consist of one or more meal items corresponding to a menu item.<br>

* **Account**: Weâ€™ll have different types of accounts in the system, one will be a receptionist to search and reserve tables and the other, the waiter will place orders in the system.<br>

* **Notification**: Will take care of sending notifications to customers.<br>

* **Bill**: Contains different bill-items for every meal item.<br>

# Code
Here is the high-level definition for the classes described above.
* **Enums, data types, and constants**: Here are the required enums, data types, and constants:<br>
```
public enum ReservationStatus {
  REQUESTED, PENDING, CONFIRMED, CHECKED_IN, CANCELED, ABANDONED
}

public enum SeatType {
  REGULAR, KID, ACCESSIBLE, OTHER
}

public enum OrderStatus {
  RECEIVED, PREPARING, COMPLETED, CANCELED, NONE
}

public enum TableStatus {
  FREE, RESERVED, OCCUPIED, OTHER
}

public enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE, CLOSED, CANCELED, BLACKLISTED, BLOCKED
}

public enum PaymentStatus {
  UNPAID, PENDING, COMPLETED, FILLED, DECLINED, CANCELLED, ABANDONED, SETTLING, SETTLED, REFUNDED
}

  private String country;
}
```
* **Account, Person, Employee, Receptionist, Manager, and Chef**: These classes represent the different people that interact with our system:<br>
```
// For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can
// assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective
// public getter methods and modified only through their public setter function.

public class Account {
  private String id;
  private String password;
  private Address address;
  private AccountStatus status;

  public boolean resetPassword();
}

public abstract class Person {
  private String name;
  private String email;
  private String phone; 
}


public abstract class Employee extends Person {
  private int employeeID;
  private Date dateJoined;
  
  private Account account;
}

public class Receptionist extends Employee {
  public boolean createReservation();
  public List<Customer> searchCustomer(String name);
}

public class Manager extends Employee {
  public boolean addEmployee();
}

public class Chef extends Employee {
  public boolean takeOrder();
}
```
* **Restaurant, Branch, Kitchen, TableChart**: These classes represent the top-level classes of the system:<br>
```
public class Kitchen {
  private String name;
  private Chef[] chefs;

  private boolean assignChef();
}

public class Branch {
  private String name;
  private Address location;
  private Kitchen kitchen;

}
```
* **Table, TableSeat, and Reservation**: Each table can have multiple seats and customers can make reservations for tables:<br>
```
public class Table {
  private int tableID;
  private TableStatus status;

  private int locationIdentifier;

  private List<TableSeat> seats;

  public boolean isTableFree();
  public boolean addReservation();

  public static List<Table> search(int capacity, Date startTime) {
    // return all tables with the given capacity and availability
  }
}

public class TableSeat {
